<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>

    alt="Everything">
<p>The film is a hilarious and big-hearted sci-fi action adventure
     about an exhausted Chinese American woman (Michelle Yeoh).</p>
<p>The film is exhilarating, funny and moving,
     and also messy, overstuffed 
     and a trifle exhausting at the same time.</p>

<h3>Everything Everywhere All at Once</h3>

    alt="Titanic">
<p>The movie is about the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic.</p>
<p>It stars Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.
     The two play characters are of different social classes.
      They fall in love after meeting aboard the ship, 
      but it was not good for a rich girl to fall in love with a poor boy in 1912.</p>
<hr>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>

    alt="Shawshank">
<p>It tells a timeless story about the little guy being wrongly punished, 
    and eventually triumphing over adversity to win the day/ get revenge.</p>
<p>The main character Andy spent over twenty years in Shawshank. 
    During those years, he relentlessly chipped away at his wall 
    until he had tunnelled all the way through and out to the other end. 
    The film sends an important message: persistence pays off.</p>
